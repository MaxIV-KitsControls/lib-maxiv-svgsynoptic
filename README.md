= SVG synoptic =


This is a rewrite of the SVG synoptic library
(https://github.com/johanfforsberg/taurus-svgsynoptic) intended to
generalize and clean things up. It is mostly complete, but is not
deployed anywhere yet so should not be considered finished. Some
important details of how it works have changed, and it is not
immediately compatible with SVG files from old versions (although the
changes should be easy to automate).  Updated documentation will
follow shortly.
